Developed and documented by GreekQuant.

This is a simple application which leverages:

1. openbb
2. streamlit

Currently openbb is used to source the macroeconomic data **for Greece** and streamlit for the front-end as well as the cloud hosting. To access the web app please follow the `link` below:
